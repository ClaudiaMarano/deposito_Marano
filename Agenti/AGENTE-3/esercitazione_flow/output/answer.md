### **Definition & Background of Cats**

1. **Species Classification**  
   Cats, scientifically known as *Felis catus*, belong to the Felidae family, within the order Carnivora. This classification was first established by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Cats share close genetic ties with other small wildcats, such as the African wildcat (*Felis lybica*) and the Asian desert cat. This genetic link is crucial for understanding their biological features and domestication journey.  

2. **Domestication History**  
   Archaeological evidence and genetic studies suggest cats were domesticated approximately 9,000 years ago in the Neolithic period, near the Fertile Crescent in the Near East. Early farmers likely facilitated this process as cats were drawn to settlements to hunt rodents. Historically, domestication was not a deliberate effort but rather a mutual relationship where cats benefited from human habitats. Over millennia, cats gradually became integral to human life, preserving many traits of their wild ancestors while adapting to co-exist with humans.  

3. **Popularity Worldwide Today**  
   Cats are now among the most popular pets globally. According to a 2023 report by the American Pet Products Association (APPA), there are approximately 95.6 million cats residing in U.S. households alone, in part due to their convenience as pets and relatively independent nature. Cats are beloved for their charming personalities, minimal care requirements, and ability to adapt to diverse living environments, from urban apartments to rural homes.
