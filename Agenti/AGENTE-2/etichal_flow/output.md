The title of the "highest man in the world" can be interpreted to mean the tallest man in history or the tallest living man. Let’s break this down:

### Tallest Man in Recorded History
The tallest man in recorded history was **Robert Wadlow**, also known as the "Alton Giant." He was born on February 22, 1918, in Alton, Illinois, USA, and grew to a staggering height of **8 feet 11.1 inches (272 cm)**. His extraordinary height was due to a condition known as hyperplasia of the pituitary gland, which caused an abnormally high production of human growth hormone.

Robert Wadlow's incredible height brought him fame, but it also led to health challenges. Despite his towering presence, which enthralled many, he struggled with mobility issues and relied on leg braces to walk. Sadly, he passed away on July 15, 1940, at the age of 22 due to an infection caused by a poorly fitted brace.

### Tallest Living Man
The tallest living man is currently **Sultan Kösen**, who was born on December 10, 1982, in Mardin, Turkey. Sultan stands at **8 feet 2.8 inches (251 cm)** tall, according to Guinness World Records. Like Robert Wadlow, Sultan's height is attributed to a condition linked to his pituitary gland, resulting in gigantism.

Sultan Kösen's life has also been deeply influenced by his extraordinary stature. He initially worked as a farmer in Turkey, but his record-breaking height brought him international attention and opportunities to travel the world. Sultan holds other notable records, including having some of the largest hands (measuring nearly 11.22 inches long).

### Conclusion
If we consider the "highest man in the world" based on historical records, **Robert Wadlow** holds the title. However, in terms of the tallest living person, it is **Sultan Kösen**. Both individuals have remarkable stories that highlight the challenges and uniqueness of extreme height.
